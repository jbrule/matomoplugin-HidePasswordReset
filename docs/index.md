## Documentation

The easiest way to install is to find the plugin in the [Matomo Marketplace](https://plugins.matomo.org/).
Just Activate on the plugin page after install and the "Lost your password?" message will be removed.
A replacement login message may be supplied on the General Settings screen (see screenshots).
